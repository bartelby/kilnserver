**Server for thermocouple/fuzzy-logic kiln control project.**

**The Architecture**
* Kilncontroller runs on the Raspberry Pi and talks to the thermocouple.
* Kilnweb is a Flask application that controls the web-based UI.

I've put the kinlweb component into kilnweb2, which is structured somewhat differently from the way that Rob structured the project.
See this page: https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/patterns/packages/ for instructions on how to 
set up, initializze and run kilnweb2.  Note that the kilnweb2 directory structure looks like this:

~~~
/kilnweb2
  /kilnweb2
    /static
    /templates
    __init__.py
    kiln_command.py
    model.py
    views.py
~~~    
The flask app lives in __init__.py and is invoked from a command window.  cd to the upper-level
kilnweb2 directory and invoke 
~~~
>flask run
~~~
Note that the environment variables and setup specified in the web page referenced above must exist.

Kilncontroller must be running before kilnweb can be started.  Kilncontroller is listening
on a unix socket for commands from kilnweb.  Kilnweb makes RESTful API calls to the socket.

**The Project**

Best run under python3 in a virtual environment.

**Roger's description of work to be done on the client:**

>I imagined that there would be two screens, which you could toggle between.  Screen 1 is a bunch of command buttons, and Screen 2 is the data table.
>
>**Screen 1:   Commands**
>* Wakeup/Reset  Establish connection to temperature programmer via WiFi & hand shake, reset.
>* NewProgram:  Start new program and give it a name (bring up kb to allow user to type name)
>* Store:  Store the program you are working on in RPi memory
>* Recall:  Recall a program by name from RPi memory â€“ bring up scroll table of all programs
>* Delete:  Delete a program by name from Rpi memory
>* Setup:  Go to screen 2 to set up temperature program
>* Review:   Review program data
>* Start:  Send start command to controller- start from beginning of program
>* Delay:  Set later time for start to commence
>* Stop:  Immediate stop & confirm
>* Restart:  Start pro
